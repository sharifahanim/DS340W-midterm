## Datasets
The dataset used ("Accident_information.csv" & "Vehicle_information.csv") for this code are from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles)
To run this code, we uploaded kaggle.json token.

## Code

'parentPaper_Naivebayes.ipynb' is the code that contains the preprocessing of the dataset and the implementation of the Naive Bayes model to analyze the road traffic accident hotspot in the UK. 

Link to the github containing the original code: https://github.com/VarunMK/UK-Road-Traffic-Hotspot-Analysis-Repo 

The scores showed similar results to what is shown in the parent paper. We will be replicate the preprocessing steps and utilize the same dataset from the parent paper and implement a new model which is Graph Neural Network.
